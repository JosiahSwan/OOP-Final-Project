# OOP-Final-Project
These are the classes and interfaces from my final project from my OOP course. It includes an abstract Podcast class to store the basic information of a podcast. AN IPlay interface which contains abstract methods to start and stop a podcast. An ILibrary interface which includes an abstract method to show the details of a podcast, and acts as the component of the composite design pattern. A PodcastComposite class which implements ILibrary and acts as the composite of the Composite Design Pattern. Educational, Interview, and Story classes which all extend Podcast and implement IPlay and ILibrary and override the methods in both interfaces, all three of these classes act as leafs in the Composite Design Pattern. Note that the overriden start and stop methods only output that the podcast has started or stopped and do nothing else. Finally, there is the Driver class which contains the main function to test all these classes and interfaces.
